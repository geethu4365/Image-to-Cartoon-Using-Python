## Introduction

The Image to Cartoon project is a fun and creative application that transforms your photos into cartoon-style images. This is achieved through image processing techniques such as edge detection, bilateral filtering, and color quantization.

## Features

- Convert images to cartoon style
- Adjustable parameters for edge detection and smoothing
- Support for various image formats.

# Usage
After installing the dependencies, you can convert images to cartoon style by running the script with your image file:
python cartoonify.py --input path/to/your/image.jpg --output path/to/save/cartoon.jpg
You can also adjust the parameters for edge detection and smoothing:
python cartoonify.py --input path/to/your/image.jpg --output path/to/save/cartoon.jpg --edge_threshold 100 --filter_diameter 9
